# Survival Analysis in R

This repository contains R scripts and data files from an university assignment focusing on survival analysis using R as part of a medical statistics module.

## Task 1: Investigating the Association Between Radiation Therapy and Survival

- **Summary**: This task explores the relationship between receiving radiation therapy (RT) and survival time using survival analysis techniques.
- **Key Findings**: Significant evidence suggests that patients who received RT have longer survival times compared to those who did not.
- **Analysis**: Includes Kaplan-Meier survival plots, hazard ratio calculations, and confidence interval estimation.

## Task 2: Analysing the Impact of KDM5C Expression Levels on Survival

- **Summary**: This task examines how different expression levels of the KDM5C gene impact survival rates among patients.
- **Key Findings**: Despite categorising KDM5C expression levels, no significant association with survival was found.
- **Methods**: Utilises log-rank tests, stratified analyses, and explores potential confounding variables such as age and sex.

## Task 3: Building a Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Model

- **Summary**: This task constructs a comprehensive Cox proportional hazards model to identify significant predictors of survival.
- **Key Findings**: Factors such as MALT1 and HOXA13 expression, along with sex and RT interaction terms, were found to significantly influence survival.
- **Approach**: Sequential model building and assessment of model assumptions, including proportional hazards and influential observations.
